/**
 */ @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a single page.
 *
 * The doctype, html, head and body tags are not in this template. Instead they
 * can be found in the html.html.twig template in this directory.
 *
 * Available variables:
 *
 * General utility variables:
 * - base_path: The base URL path of the Drupal installation. Will usually be
 *   "/" unless you have installed Drupal in a sub-directory.
 * - is_front: A flag indicating if the current page is the front page.
 * - logged_in: A flag indicating if the user is registered and signed in.
 * - is_admin: A flag indicating if the user has permission to access
 *   administration pages.
 *
 * Site identity:
 * - front_page: The URL of the front page. Use this instead of base_path when
 *   linking to the front page. This includes the language domain or prefix.
 *
 * Navigation:
 * - breadcrumb: The breadcrumb trail for the current page.
 *
 * Page content (in order of occurrence in the default page.html.twig):
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title: The page title, for use in the actual content.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - messages: Status and error messages. Should be displayed prominently.
 * - tabs: Tabs linking to any sub-pages beneath the current page (e.g., the
 *   view and edit tabs when displaying a node).
 * - action_links: Actions local to the page, such as "Add menu" on the menu
 *   administration interface.
 * - node: Fully loaded node, if there is an automatically-loaded node
 *   associated with the page and the node ID is the second argument in the
 *   page's path (e.g. node/12345 and node/12345/revisions, but not
 *   comment/reply/12345).
 *
 * Regions:
 * - page.header: Items for the header region.
 * - page.navigation: Items for the navigation region.
 * - page.navigation_collapsible: Items for the navigation (collapsible) region.

            <p>
            Geisel Software is located in the historic Higgins Armory at 100 Barber Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. For almost one-hundred years, Higgins Armory stood as a symbol of stability and security. It was once the only museum dedicated solely to arms and armor and was the second largest collection of such items in the United States (behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC).
            </p>
            <p>
            It's hard to imagine a better place for a modern software development company, tasked with arming your software against present-day threats of all kinds. While nations once battled nations with swords and shields, today even your software may be attacked by nation-state level threats. It would seem that Higgins Armory still hosts a world of defensive armor, but today it has replaced chain mail and steel shields with secured software and strong encryption.
