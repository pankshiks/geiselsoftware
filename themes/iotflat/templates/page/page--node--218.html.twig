	                  	        		<p class="first-child">Are you obsessed with software, apps and the Internet? Looking to gain valuable experience working in a modern, successful software company? Geisel Software, based in Worcester, Massachusetts, is a premier software developer that is working with and creating today's hottest software technologies. We are looking for a motivated individual to join our team, learn new technology, and help us build some great software!</p>
	                  	        		<p>Geisel Software specializes in web, mobile and Internet of Things software. We seek a talented individual who is not afraid to work hard, learn something new and get lots of stuff done. We have a helpful staff, but it is also important that you can work independently and solve problems with little outside direction. Your problem-solving skills will be put to the test, whether that means tracking down the answer on Google, or building your own new solution.</p>
	                  	        		<p>This posting is for an iOS Developer with 2-5 years of experience in iOS Development, using Swift. The current project is 3 months, with a possible extension or the possibility of getting pulled into other projects afterwards. This job description includes the kinds of things we regularly work with in case you might be interested in joining us permanently. However, this job posting is specifically for an iOS developer. If you’re experienced in any of the other things, that’s a great bonus for this role.</p>
